<p> The list of web "X11 colors" from the CSS3 specification, along with their hexadecimal hskfhsdk 
hdaskhdFor example, consider the color where the red/green/blue values are decimal numbers: red=36, green=104,
 blue=160 (a grayish-blue color). The decimal numbers 36, 104 and 160 are equivalent to the hexadecimal numbers 24, 68 
 and A0 respectively. The hex triplet is obtained by concatenating the six hexadecimal digits together, 2468A0 in this example.

<h2> A blockquote</h2>
<blockquote>
A number of colors are defined by web browsers. A particular browser may not recognize all of these colors, but as of 2005, 
all modern, general-use, graphical browsers support the full list of colors. Many of these colors are from the list of X11 
color names distributed with the X Window System. These colors were standardized by SVG 1.0, and are accepted by SVG Full
 user agents. They are not part of SVG Tiny.
